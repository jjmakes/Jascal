# Jascal

A small programming language with syntax similar to Pascal. A lexical analyzer extracts tokens and are interpreted with a recursive-descent parser.

## Instructions

The language requires a C++ compiler. Examples here will use g++.

To compile, run:
```
g++ lex.cpp parseInt.cpp jascal.cpp -o main.exe
```
To run a file, pass its name as a parameter for the compiled executable:
```
./main.exe ./tests/testprog14
```

**Sample Program:**

```
PROGRAM circle;
	(*Clean Program*)
VAR
	(*Variable declarations*)
	r, a, p, b : REAL; 
	i, j, sum : INTEGER;
	str1, str2: STRING;	
BEGIN
	i := 8;
	p := 6;
	a := 0;
	sum := 0;
	str1 := 'Hello World!';
	j := -3;
	IF ( p > 5) THEN
	  	a := (3.14) + j * - p
	ELSE
		IF (p = 0 ) THEN str1 := 'Hello';
		
	     
	(*Display the results*)
	WRITELN  ('The output results are: ' , p, ' ', str1, ' ', a, ' ', i, ' ', j);
END
```

## EBNF Grammar Rules
1. Prog ::= PROGRAM IDENT; DeclBlock ProgBody
2. DeclBlock ::= VAR {DeclStmt;}
3. DeclStmt ::= Ident {, Ident} : (Integer | Real | String)
4. ProgBody ::= BEGIN {Stmt;} END
5. Stmt ::= AssigStmt | IfStmt | WriteLnStmt
6. WriteLnStmt ::= WRITELN (ExprList)
7. IfStmt ::= IF ( LogicExpr ) THEN Stmt [ELSE Stmt]
8. AssignStmt ::= Var := Expr
9. ExprList ::= Expr {, Expr}
10. Expr ::= Term {(+|-) Term}
11. Term ::= SFactor {( * | / ) SFactor}
12. SFactor ::= [(+ | -)] Factor
13. LogicExpr ::= Expr (= | > | <) Expr
14. Var ::= IDENT
15. Factor ::= IDENT | ICONST | RCONST | SCONST | (Expr)

## Language Description
- The language consists of types: **INTEGER**, **REAL**, and **STRING**.
- Precedence rules:

| Highest |
| ------------- |
| Unary +, unary - |
| *./(Left Associative) |
| +(add),-(subtract)(Left Associative) |
| =, <, > (relation operators) |
| Lowest |

- All variables have to be declared in declaration statements in the declaration block.
- An IfStmt evaluates a logical expression (LogicExpr) as a condition. If the logical expression value is true, then the Stmt block is executed, otherwise it is not. An else part for an IfSmt is optional.
- A WriteLnStmt evaluates the list of expressions (ExprList), and prints their values in order from left to right followed by a newline.
- The ASSOP operator (:=) in the AssignStmt assigns a value to a variable. It evaluates the Expr on the right-hand side and saves its value in a memory location associated with the left-hand side variable (Var). 
- A left-hand side variable of a numeric type can be assigned a value of either one of the numeric types (i.e., INTEGER, REAL) of the language. 
- A left-hand side STRING
variable can only be assigned a STRING value.
- The binary operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are performed upon two numeric operands (i.e., INTEGER, REAL) of the same or different types. If the operands are of the same type, the type of the result is the same type as the operatorâ€™s operands. Otherwise, the type of the result is REAL.
- The EQUAL LTHAN and GTHAN relational operators operate upon two compatible operands. The evaluation of a logical expression, based on EQUAL, LTHAN or GTHAN operation, produces either a true or false value that controls whether the statement(s) of the selection IfStmt is executed or not.
- It is an error to use a variable in an expression before it has been assigned.
- The unary sign operators (+ or -) are applied upon unary numeric operands (i.e., INTEGER, REAL).

## Lexical Rules
### Identifiers
- IDENT: `/^[a-zA-Z_$][a-zA-Z_0-9]*$/`
- Letter: `/[a-zA-Z]/`
- Digit: `/[0-9]/`
###  Integer constants
- ICONST: `/[0-9]+/`
### Real constants
- RCONST: `/^[0-9]*.[0-9]+$/`
### String constants
String literals must appear on the same line when defined.
- SCONST: `/^'.+'$/`
### Operators (-,=,\*,/,(,),:=,=,<,>)
- Math: `/[-+*/]/`
- Parenthesis:`/[()]/`
- Assign: `/^:=$/`
- Comparison: `/[=><]/`
### Comments (* \*)
Comments may overlap one line.
- Comments: `/\(\*.*\*\)/`
### Reserved Words
Program, end, beign, writeln, if, integer, real, string, else, var

## Recursive-Descent Parser & Interpreter
The parser includes one function per fule or nonterminal. Each function recognizes the right hand side of the rule. All recursive-descent functions take a reference to an input stream and line number, and return a Boolean value.

The interpreter builds information of variables and types in a map container for all the defined variables. It evaluates expressions and determines their values and types. A map container keeps a record of the defined variables in the parsed program.
